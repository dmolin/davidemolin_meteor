davidemolin.com Website, using MeteorJS, React and Redux!
==========================================================================

This project (now offline) was phasing out the previous MeteorJS Mantra-based version (you can find it [here](https://github.com/dmolin/www.davidemolin.com-meteor-react)) and adopting a full Redux approach for managing UI state.


### Technologies Used ###

- MeteorJS 1.3
- React 0.14.8
- Redux
- React-Komposer, to integrate Meteor realtime reactivity within Redux (see [here](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-komposer))
- BabelJS (ES2015 transpiler)
- Unit Testing with Enzyme, Mocha and Chai
- mupx (Meteor Up) for production deployments
