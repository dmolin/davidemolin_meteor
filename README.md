davidemolin.com Website, using MeteorJS, React and Redux!
==========================================================================

This is a work in progress, with the idea of replacing the current production website implemented with Meteor + React + Mantra.
This new version, still in development, is phasing out Mantra and adopting a full Redux approach for managing UI state.

You can see the current live website [here](http://davidemolin.com)

### Technologies Used ###

- MeteorJS 1.3
- React 0.14.8
- Redux
- React-Komposer, to integrate Meteor realtime reactivity within Redux (see [here](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-komposer))
- BabelJS (ES2015 transpiler)
- Unit Testing with Enzyme, Mocha and Chai
- mupx (Meteor Up) for production deployments

Being a migration of the current production website, the whole process should be fairly quick and result in a production deployment before April 15.
